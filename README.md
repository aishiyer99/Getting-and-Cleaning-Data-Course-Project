* codebook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work done to clean the data.

* run_analysis.R prepares the data for tidying and then targets the given questions in the assignment:
1) It merges the training and test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts the measurements of mean and standard deviation.
3) Descriptively names the activities in the data set. 
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) Finally, it generates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of every variable for each activity and each subject.

* FinalData.txt is the final result. (Exported final data after going through the above processes.)
